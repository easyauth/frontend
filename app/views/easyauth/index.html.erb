            <p>At this point, these should be testing certificates
            rather than production certificates. Before anything is
            made publicly available, these would be replaced with
            production certificates. Unlike Let's Encrypt, we do
            not need these to be signed by a reputable
            certification authority; trust verification occurs
            because the applications using the certificates issued
            by this authority already know of and trust the
            authority; in fact, they trust it exclusively.</p>
